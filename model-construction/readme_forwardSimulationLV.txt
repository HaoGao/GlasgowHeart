1. update the folder to save temporary computations in DirConfigForwardComputation_HV01.m
line 21, abaqusDir = path to save your results, in the current foder, it locates here './computation/HV01'
Note: inside HV01, there are a lot of pre-defined files which are needed for the forward simulation. If you want to run a new model (using different person's heart), then I will need to prepare a new setting for you. 

2, run forwardSimulationLV.m
